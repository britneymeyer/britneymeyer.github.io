		<p>
			Under my tutelage, your child will be given numerous reading opportunities that are based entirely on
			their specific needs and abilities including (but not limited to):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Phonics/Decoding Skills</li>
			<li>Comprehension</li>
			<li>Fluency</li>
			<li>Accuracy</li>
			<li>Vocabulary</li>
		</ol>
		<p><b>
			I consider literacy to be the most important skill that a child will obtain throughout their educational career.
			It is used across all curricula, and it is essential to becoming successful in life. However, literacy is one of
			the hardest skills to foster in a child. If a child struggles with reading or they acquire a dislike of reading,
			it can be difficult to encourage them to continue developing their literacy skills.
		</b></p>
		<li>Informal Reading and spelling assessments</li>
		<p>
			If desired, these tests will allow me to assess your childâ€™s abilities and determine the grade level(s) at which
			they are currently reading, writing, and listening. In addition, it will determine his or her specific strengths
			and weaknesses in each of the aforementioned areas.
		</p>
		<li>Summer School</li>
		<p>
			If your child is struggling with a topic or they want to get a head start on the upcoming school year, I can
			create custom lesson plans and activities to help develop their understanding of a particular topic or subject.
