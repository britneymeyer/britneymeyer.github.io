          Hi, my name is Britney, and I am a certified teacher looking to help students be successful in all aspects of
          their education by providing one-on-one instruction tailored to their developmental needs.

            <br><br>

          My goal is to foster a love of learning in all students and help their education grow using a variety of
          teaching strategies and activities that align with their particular learning styles, intelligences,
          and exceptionalities.

            <br><br>

          I graduated from the University of Central Missouri three years ago with my Bachelor’s in Elementary
          Education with a minor in English. Throughout my courses, I acquired over eight years of teaching experience
          in many different facets of education. I am certified to teach first grade through sixth grade in the state
          of Missouri. I was also a member of the Honors College, and with the collaboration of a faculty mentor,
          I created a supplementary educational resource called Content Area Tunes (CATs). CATs are songs written to
          familiar tunes that help teach students about a particular topic (i.e. Mesopotamian culture). Eventually I
          want to return to college and get my Master’s Degree in Children’s Literature.

            <br><br>

          I am constantly reading teaching books and journals to learn better ways to educate students of all types of
          intelligences and learning styles. I am currently reading “The CAFE Book” written by Gail Boushey and
          Joan Moser about effective ways to engage students in literacy.
